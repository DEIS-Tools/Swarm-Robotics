#Vision

A swarm of autonomous mobile robots are moving throughout a factory. They each have several items that they need to collect in order to finish an order. The scenario is inspired by the packing of Lego bricks for a bag, which is one part of what goes into Lego set. The robots should never collide and are thus equipped with sensors so that they themselves can avoid collision.
